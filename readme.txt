 Tsutsui H, Oka Y.
 Slow removal of Na(+) channel inactivation underlies the temporal filtering
 property in the teleost thalamic neurons.
 J Physiol 2002 Mar 15;539(Pt 3):743-53.

The authors found a novel Na current in teleost thalamic nuclei was well 
described by the m^3 h Hodgkin-Huxley model. The kinetic parameters derived 
from their experiments (see the reference for details) revealed that the 
h gate had a large time constant (~100ms at -80 to -50mV). This explains the 
thalamic neurons long refractory period and the gradual recovery of AP 
amplitude as the inter spike interval grows. 

To run it is easiest to autolaunch and select the figure 6A,6B, or 7A.

Otherwise follow the usual procedure of downloading the zip file,
extracting, and compiling the mod file with mknrndll, or nrnivmodl
depending on whether using windows, mac, or unix.

Then run mosinit.hoc with nrngui in the usual way for your system
(typing on the command line, draggin and dropping or double clicking)

bug: that repetitions of fig 7A produces an error has been noted.
